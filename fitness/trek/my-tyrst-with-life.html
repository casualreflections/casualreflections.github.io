<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0ByRdgrKLgEgIZUxuM3hpeXJaUGM" alt="Tryst" /></p>

<p>I happened to view a really motivational <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx9v_J34Fyo" target="_blank">video</a> of Ms. Arunima a couple of days of back, its really motivational, about how we restrict ourselves in our mind, how possibilities are endless with constant persistent effort despite all odds. If you haven’t, a must watch.</p>

<p>What it did to me? It reminded me yet again of a fateful 2013 summer night where I was out trying to ascend Stok Kangri - Standing at 20,187 ft, the highest trekkable peak of India and probably the world (ignoring Mt. Aconcagua - regarded by many as a walkable peak). The memories of my first failed attempt are so vivid in my mind that I can possibly count seconds of that long summit night, you don’t get close to dying everyday do you? I decided to pen my experience down as I thought it could be of some help to fellow trekkers who may not be prepared for worst like how I was.</p>

<h1 id="goa">Goa:</h1>
<p>It was my last semester in college and I was working with an inspirational Prof- Durgesh Samant. After an academic discussion of ours, I happened to ask him about his hobbies - he in is calm succinct demeanor told me he loves climbing mountains. I was pretty amazed as it’s not a hobby which people usually have in academia. It looked like an exciting venture, who doesn’t like mountains after all? I happened to like the idea and researched online, the experiences of people were amazing and I decided to climb a peak with Durgesh sir soon.</p>

<p>He happened to move to Bombay to pursue his PhD, but we stayed in touch and discussed plans to ascend Stok Kangri in the coming summers. The challenge appeared quite daunting for us - we being newbies, lacking experience. We thought a good test of our prep would be to try out a  more forgiving trek, the Roopkund trek, which at 16,499ft in itself is quite an experience - we happened to do it with a group just couple of days after the trek had opened for the year, the last camp at Bhagwabasa was unsuitable to stay due to heavy snow and tents could not have been pitched there. It was decided by our Trek Lead to do the last two day trek from Patar Nachuni, the 2nd last camp. It was something I hadn’t thought I would be capable of - 10 hrs continuous uphill climb and then a 8 hr descend starting at 12 in the night to evening next day, an inexplicable feeling.</p>

<h1 id="ladakh">Ladakh:</h1>
<p>For about a month and few days I worked on my fitness, walked, ran, climbed stairs - 200-250 floors a day started becoming a normal affair. I began meeting the stipulated fitness guidelines and it appeared that Stok Kangri could permit us to its top. I learnt that peak of K2 is visible from its top with naked eye during clear skies and I couldn’t wait to experience it myself.</p>

<p>We reached Leh, a town in the district of Ladakh on 28th June, it’s an excellent tourist spot, many were there to travel and explore the beauty but we had our vision firm on Stok Kangri - A peak which is visible distinctly from all Leh. We met our group mates and acclimatized ourselves at the place as it suffers scarcity of oxygen.</p>

<p>We planned a bike ascent to Khardungla - touted as highest motorable road. We thought that it will give us a decent idea as to how our bodies behave at extreme altitude.
It’s 40 km from Leh and involves climbing a 6,000+ ft climb and it was crazy adventure at that height, we collectively conceded the goal of reaching Khardungla due to poor road condition and breathing issues at South Pullu with around 10Km south of Khardungla. Next day was off as well and some of us decided to have a look around Leh while relentless Durgesh sir decided to do Khardungla again Solo and boy he did it!</p>

<p>Next day was our first day of the trek to ChangMa after a short bus trip to Stok, I found it pretty easy and the group managed to do it in 3-4 hours. I happened to meet one of the fittest female I have ever met, Emily Bridger (I’d say fittest of the lot, quite easily). It was quite a revelation to explore wild with people having varied backgrounds, wildlife photographers, social workers, engineers. We were 24 and little did we know that only a select few will be able to make it to the top a few days later.</p>

<p>We ascended next couple of days to Mankorma and then to the Base Camp. As advanced base camp of Stok is banned by the locals for camping citing pollution to Stok Glacier, the final ascent begins from Base camp and 2 day trek is done in a single night (similar to what Durgesh sir and I had experienced at Roopkund), although insanely daunting - from 16,000 ft to 20,187 at low levels of oxygen. We had a rest day at base camp and after taking some rest, acclimatization walk,we prepared ourselves for summit climb starting at 11 in the night. Why climb in the night? - Snow is hardest at night and requires minimal effort and the weather is calm as well.</p>

<h1 id="the-summit-climb">The Summit Climb:</h1>
<p>We were divided into two groups by our trek lead Sandeep Rawat - one that would start at 11 &amp; one that would start an hour later. 5 of us were kept in the 2nd batch, including me, Emily and Durgesh sir. We started at 12, the target was to summit at 6-7 in the morning and climb down.At night, the temperature was expected to drop to its lowest levels, upto -20 deg, this would be the first time our bodies had experienced such temperatures coupled with scarce oxygen , this was daunting despite being equipped with the finest accouterments.. Things went really smooth, at least for me for the next 2-3 hours, we chased the group which had started an hour before in about 2 hours - we were quite fast. The whole path to Stok was illuminated by headlights of trekkers and it was quite a beautiful sight. We reached advanced base camp by 3am, on the base of Stok. Breathing heavy, every step now required more oxygen than the previous one. The climb to ridge is steep and extremely daunting, involving a 40-45 deg incline and demanded the best in us.</p>

<h1 id="ams">AMS:</h1>
<p>After probably going up 1000 ft further (could have been at around 18.5K alt. overall), I developed a very sharp headache. I brushed  it aside as fatigue due to the  extreme cold weather and continued to climb higher. Soon, after climbing to almost the  top of the ridge the uneasiness got beyond my control and I could clearly see it as being a symptom of AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness). I had done everything i could to acclimatize myself, spent time getting fit, Roopkund! Perhaps everyone’s body behaves differently to low oxygen. I started feeling queasy and puked all the water I had taken in. Despite the sickness, the drive to climb was still there and we climbed further. But with each passing step it was only getting worse. It was fraught with danger - I had puked 20 times or even more and my body was not responding appropriately to reduced oxygen.With the peak distinctly visible right in front ,I decided to let go of the group.I did not want to hamper their efforts or impair Durgesh sir’s chances, I knew how badly he wanted to get to the top and distinctly remember the look of helplessness in his eyes.</p>

<p>I searched for a patch of rocks to sit amidst the mountain full of snow and started waiting for the next group. I was dizzy and as the group started disappearing out of sight I started shivering. Half a dozen layers of best clothing were of no help at -20 deg peak cold of the night. Fingers started getting numb with each passing minute, 2 layers of gloves did not seem to help much either. I was dehydrated. In response to this, I started dozing off in another 10 mins, in a way I have not experienced, I had to use an insane amount of conscious effort to keep myself awake. I knew that  if I fall asleep I’d roll down the 45 deg slope to the base of the mountain to a certain death. Things were only headed for the worse and my entire body was shivering - I was drenched in sweat due to the past 4 hour climb and suddenly I exposed myself to -20 deg.I removed my gloves to find the tips of my fingers blue and numb, the horrors of hypothermia that I had only read in books were being discovered.</p>

<p>I decided that I’m in no position to climb down alone in low visibility, in deteriorated medical state with reduced senses. I figured that  staying put  on that rocky patch was the best way out. I kept the watch for the next set of people, did all sorts of calculations about when they may arrive at this point, 1 hr more perhaps. But their lights weren’t visible anywhere in vicinity.</p>

<p>The group that I started with was nowhere to be seen either, they must have reached closer to  the ridge. It was at that point when I heard a loud noise of rocks falling down from somewhere higher up. Some of them struck the rocks around me and made a cracking sound. Soon one of them whisked past right next to me, I had never ever felt so helpless and I knew if one of those boulder rocks strike me I’m done. I assumed that it could be falling of the people going up and I shouted in vain. I thought I can’t do much about it and sought shelter behind a larger piece of rock.</p>

<p>It was around 90 mins and still the headlights of the other group was not visible, let alone them reaching  my spot. My headlight had a feature to announce SOS (series of light actions to announce emergency) and i switched that on, at 4:15 on top of a mountain that is not ready to forgive. I started moving my fingers of feet and hand to get as much blood flowing through them, I was prepared for worse. I contemplated walking down but it was precarious and with the kind of state I was in it was a no brainer to stay put. Sitting amidst frozen ice with dizziness, amidst rockfall, amidst freezing body, amidst worst fears, amidst a complete state of helplessness I took a sip of water, I sat for another 20 mins. It appeared that my whole life passed in front of me in a flash. All the mistakes I had done in my life, the  plans I had for myself, people whom I may have knowingly/unknowingly hurt.</p>

<h1 id="a-ray-of-light">A ray of light:</h1>
<p>After more than 2 hrs from when I got detached with my group, I saw the first human being in vicinity. It had to be Prakash Kandpal, our other trek lead with the 2nd group. It took them a while for them to climb and see me, notice the SOS, and when they did, they dispatched couple of guides. I stood up and started to descend, I was accompanied by the guides and we rushed to the base camp. The AMS situation improved as soon as we reached advanced base camp and we reached our camp close to 7. After a cup of hot tea and sitting out in sun, I was in a much better state of mind and body.</p>

<p>A short while later, Durgesh sir returned after summiting, I felt really proud of him and tears rolled off my eyes. I knew the incredible amount of hardwork and perseverance he had put in. I considered myself blessed to be alive, what if i had succumbed to dizziness and slept, rolled down to certain death? What if i had decided to climb down and stumbled in that physical state?</p>

<p>I was told by Durgesh sir that only the 4 members of the group i was climbing with could make it to the top, none from the 2nd group could make it. I found it unfortunate. 4/24 is not a ratio you’d expect after the enormous efforts put in the training.</p>

<p>The group was leaving the same day around noon and after getting a short nap just before we were to go down, I speculated a possibility of doing the climb again with the next group. I’d call myself crazy right now at that but at that point I was angry at the mountain and the only thought was how to overcome it.</p>

<p>I called my dad to let him know I couldn’t reach to the top, asked him to cancel tickets, booked a tent with Maitree and decided to acclimatize, eat and give it another shot. The best shot.</p>

<h1 id="victory">Victory!</h1>
<p>After climbing a new peak almost everyday, with some of the most interesting people I have ever met in my life, reaching close to 19k ft height everyday from basecamp, giving my body the best chance to do it this time around.</p>

<p>A week later, I was joined by the next group - 24 Thai trekkers lead by an experienced mountaineer who was eyeing Mt. Everest. It turned out to be a cakewalk, the efforts paid off. I did the summit early in the morning after sunrise and by the time others were at the top, I was sipping hot tea with maggie back at the base camp.</p>
